Sir this is the best we try. 
we just try to implement the code by using what we know and try to use database concept to implement the idea.
here whe have used some simple php code but we tried our best to use database concept like, join, to select information from all table at once. 
just we tryied to implement what we had written in documentation. thank you sir!!
